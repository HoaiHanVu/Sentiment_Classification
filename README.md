# Sentiment Classification with Traditional ML Models and 1D Convolution Network, Deployed with Streamlit
## Introduction

This project aims to address the challenges of Vietnamese language processing by classifying customer comments about restaurants on the Foody restaurant review website. We have developed a model that utilizes both traditional machine learning models and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for sentiment classification. The deep learning network has demonstrated excellent performance, achieving an impressive omission rate of only 20% for negative comments. This has greatly aided restaurants in enhancing their service quality.



## Features

- Traditional ML Models: Our repository includes the implementation of traditional machine learning models tailored for sentiment classification in Vietnamese text.
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network: Additionally, a 1D CNN model has been built to leverage deep learning techniques for accurate sentiment prediction.
- Streamlit Deployment: We have utilized Streamlit to deploy the sentiment classification model as a user-friendly web application. This allows users to easily input Vietnamese customer comments and receive sentiment classifications in real-time.

## Insights

During the course of this project, an important realization was made regarding the handling and cleaning of Vietnamese language with its complex layers of meaning. Overly cautious pre-processing can potentially degrade the model's performance, prompting a need for careful consideration of language nuances.

## Usage

- Review the provided code and models for sentiment classification.
- Install the necessary dependencies, including Streamlit, to run the application.
- Deploy the sentiment classification model using Streamlit by running the corresponding script.
