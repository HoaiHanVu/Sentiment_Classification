# Sentiment Classification with Traditional ML Models and 1D Convolution Network
## Introduction

This repository focuses on sentiment classification for Vietnamese language using both traditional machine learning models and a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to classify customer comments about restaurants on the Foody restaurant review website. The model's performance has been evaluated, with a significant improvement observed in service quality as the omission rate for negative comments reduced to only 20%.

## Features

- Traditional ML Models: The repository includes implementation of traditional machine learning models, which offer a different approach to sentiment classification for Vietnamese language.
- 1D Convolutional Neural Network: Additionally, a 1D CNN model has been built to tackle the sentiment classification task. This deep learning approach has shown promising results in accurately predicting sentiments.
- Improved Service Quality: The project's ultimate objective is to enhance restaurant service quality by effectively identifying and addressing negative customer feedback.

## Insights

During the course of this project, an important realization was made regarding the handling and cleaning of Vietnamese language with its complex layers of meaning. Overly cautious pre-processing can potentially degrade the model's performance, prompting a need for careful consideration of language nuances.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine (will be updated soon).
2. Review the provided code and models for sentiment classification.
3. Use the traditional ML models or the 1D CNN model to classify sentiments in Vietnamese customer comments.
4. Explore and modify the code as needed for your own sentiment classification tasks.
